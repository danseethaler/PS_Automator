# PS-Automator
PeopleSoft Automation Tool for Quick Navigation and Automated Data Input

This Chrome Extension is designed to add functionality to Chrome when working in PeopleSoft. The page action icon will only be displayed when the subdomain of the active page is one of the four designated prefixes. Clicking on the page action icon will open a small window with navigation buttons (squares) and data entry buttons (rectangles).

## Special Features
- A left click on a navigation button (square buttons) will navigate to the specified page in the current browser tab. A right-click will maintain the content of the current page by opening and new tab and navigating to the specified page after the new tab has loaded.

- Typed EmpID : When the page action window is open simply type in a six digit empID number to use in the navigation. Once six digits are keyed in the characters will change from red text to black text. Once a navigation button is clicked on the 6 digit number will also be copied to your clipboard for further navigation/use.
